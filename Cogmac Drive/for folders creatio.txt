for folder creation i will asssign a new field to file collection --folderName or folder 


then will make a fucntion so admin and managers can create folders and we have to create a new db collection 
name as folders which will conatin --dept ,foldername,role,


so whenver a folder will be cerated then its details will be saved in the folders collection 

and we will create two seperate display for folders and files in home section of both manager and admin

and we will assign a new field folderName in files collection too so that whenver a file will be uploaded it can be uploaded
insdie any folder and they can copy and paste any file inside a folder or multiple folders
